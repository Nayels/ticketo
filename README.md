# Ticketo
Ticketo is an app that makes it easy to categorise and scan receipts. That way, there is no shoebox or searching around. Just scan and throw away.

The app is a result of a university minor named 'Mobile Application Development'. This repository contains the app in native iOS and Ionic to evaluate which platform is best suited for the development of the app.
In this scenario the best solution is native as it offers better compatibility with mobile sensor data like a camera, but also OCR and ML integrations. 

## Hybrid
The hybrid app uses Ionic 3. Ionic uses Typescript, HTML and SASS, because of that it's a simple to for a webdeveloper to create an app.

## Native
The native app uses Swift 4.

## Authors
The apps are a joint effort of:
